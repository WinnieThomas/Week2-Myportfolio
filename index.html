        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I am hardworking, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and embrace changes. 
            I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. 
            Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide.I am a self motivated and target oriented person.
            I am great as a team member and also loves working on self.</p>
